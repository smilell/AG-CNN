# AG-CNN
The model of "Attention-based CNN for Glaucoma Detection (AG-CNN)", which has been published as "Attention Based Glaucoma Detection: A Large-scale Database with a CNN Model".

# LAG-Database
The LAG database contains 11,760 fundus images corresponding to 4,878 suspecious and 6,882 negative glaucoma samples. All the samples are labeled with the diagnosis results (0 refers to negative glaucoma and 1 refers to suspecious glaucoma).
5,824 fundus images are further labeled with attention regions based on an alternative method for eye tracking, in which 2,392 are positive glaucoma and the rest 3,432 are negative glaucoma.
