# AG-CNN
The model of "Attention-based CNN for Glaucoma Detection (AG-CNN)", has been published as "Attention Based Glaucoma Detection: A Large-scale Database with a CNN Model".

# LAG-Database
The LAG database contains 11,760 fundus images corresponding to 4,878 suspicious and 6,882 negative glaucoma samples. All the samples are labelled with the diagnosis results (0 refers to negative glaucoma and 1 refers to suspicious glaucoma).
5,824 fundus images are further labelled with attention regions based on an alternative method for eye tracking, in which 2,392 are positive glaucoma and the rest 3,432 are negative glaucoma.

# Download
We have uploaded the first part of our LAG database at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7mcngr3xhlaj5uc/LAG_database_part_1.rar?dl=0) under request. Please contact us for the passport.

Note that the LAG database should ONLY be used for academic purposes and other usage is refused. Also, it is NOT allowed to re-upload the LAG database on the internet.

# Licence
Our work is conducted according to the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration. As the retrospective nature and fully anonymized usage of colour retinal fundus images, we are exempted by the medical ethics committee from informing the patients.
